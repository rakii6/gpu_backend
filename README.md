# IndieGPU Backend – FastAPI + Docker + RTX 4070

This is the exact code running https://indiegpu.com 24/7  
(this repo is maintained and owned by Raktim Pradip Barua)

What’s inside:
- Real-time WebSocket sending VRAM/temp every 2 seconds  
- Secure file upload (size limit + path traversal blocked)  
- Docker + NVIDIA GPU passthrough (works on consumer cards)  
- Stripe webhook handling (test mode)

Happy to share screen / give temp access during interview.
